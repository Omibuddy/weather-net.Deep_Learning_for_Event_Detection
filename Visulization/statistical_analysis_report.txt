RESEARCH QUESTIONS ADDRESSED:
--------------------------------------------------

Q1: Does temporal modeling improve over pure CNN?
   Answer: Yes, temporal modeling improves R² by 0.008

Q2: Is the hybrid approach better than pure recurrent models?
   Answer: Cannot determine - no pure recurrent models in comparison

Q3: What's the optimal architecture for this climate prediction task?
   Answer: CNN-LSTM-GRU shows best performance (R² = 0.928)

LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
• Limited to three architecture types
• No pure LSTM/GRU comparison
• No hyperparameter optimization
• Different model capacities not controlled

RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Train pure LSTM and GRU models for fair comparison
• Conduct hyperparameter optimization for each architecture
• Use cross-validation for more robust evaluation
• Consider ensemble methods combining different architectures
